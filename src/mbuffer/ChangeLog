20060324:
- added option -c to enable synchronous data integrity I/O:
  This was enabled by default until now, but may cause a decrease in
  performance as it requires a higher number of I/O ops. On systems
  without full synchronous data integrity support, no difference will
  be observable concerning performance. Systems that support it, will
  gain increased performace without -c, but error reporting will be 
  more precise with -c.

  filesystem on some operating systems

  to put a buffer file

20051003:
- increased maximum value of number of blocks
- doku updates
